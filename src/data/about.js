        aboutText: "I am a front-end Web Developer that is currently completing BCIT's Technical Web Design program. Web design and development inspires me, to find creative solutions to technical problems, to dream up enjoyable and aesthetic designs for the user to experience, and to always keep learning.\nI spent the last nine years working as a structural drafter, before deciding it was time for a change. That time gave me a lot of experience working on collaborative projects, and striving to create high-quality, detailed work on tight deadlines.\nAs a web developer, I appreciate the creative problem solving that comes with designing something aesthetic and functional. I enjoy creating dynamic websites, and am always excited for a challenge.",
